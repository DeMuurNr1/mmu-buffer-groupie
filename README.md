Scaleable MMU buffer
A MMU bufer based on my personal wishes and desires.

Tried to make it a lightweight and cheap buffer but in the end found I liked a more extensive version better.

BOM:
M5 threaded rod
lanes*4        xxxxx bearings 
Lanes+1       98x400x2mm plastic windows
lanes*2        6x3 round magnets
lanes*2         ECAS fitting
